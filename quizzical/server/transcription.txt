 AWHC is the nation's leading authority on using fertility control to manage populations of wild horses. We have darted thousands of wild mayors with birth control, and I've proven that fertility control is a more humane and cost-effective way to keep wild horse populations in check. AWHC's programs will save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and eliminate the need for cruel and inhumane helicopter roundups. The American Wild Horse Campaign is planning to scale up our initial success into a complete program that will dart tens of thousands of horses in the 10 states where wild horses live today. To do that, we need to be able to manage the medical records of all of those mayors we dart in detail. We're building a new mobile app that darters will be able to use in the field to administer birth control to horses. That app is called the Wild Horse Animal Identifier or Wild Horse Annie for short. Wild Horse Annie uses artificial intelligence to identify individual horses and bring up their medical records. The eye in Wild Horse Annie is based on the Wild Me Engine, which has been used to protect over 50 species in the wild to date. We face a big challenge, however, this is where you come in. We need photos of real horses to train Wild Horse Annie. Each person can send us up to 10 pictures of their horse in various poses and under different lighting conditions. Shots of horses together or separate or fine just no more than 10 per horse. We need a shot from the front, we need a shot from each side, and then some different pictures of your horse in different poses. Make it fun for your horse too. Take your first round in the morning and then come back in the afternoon. Pick the 10 that are the clearest and best and upload them into the app. Click the share button and post your collage of photos to your friends on social media. Thank you for your support of Keeping Wild Horse's Wild.

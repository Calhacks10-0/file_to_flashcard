 My name is Paar Singh and I'm running for the press in the United States as a Republican candidate. We have a lot of problems that is hurting everyday Americans. Inflation is rising, the price of gas, the price of food, the price of tools and services that are needed by every American for a function life is at stake. We need to implement and focus on common sense politics to make our second amendment white stronger. I know climate changes an issue but we have other issues that need to focus on. Our only hope is Lord Jesus. He is our savior and I am his messenger. So vote for me.
